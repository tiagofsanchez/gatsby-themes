<center> <h1>Playing with gatsby themes</h1> </center>

This is the Repo where I am keeping all my gatsby-themes. Here you will find: 
- gatsby-theme-acmeblog-data (data pipes)
- gatsby-theme-acmeblog (a nice acme blog, all the styling here)
- gatsby-theme-tfs (my personal digital garden, all the styling here)
  
This separation of concerns makes sense for me. When I am writing something I am doing it in `md` or `mdx`, I keep everything in one place with very limited code and styling considerations. In short I am trying to keep code distractions to the minimum only to consider them when I need to create richer components and render them in `mdx`. 

Check the gatsby-theme-tfs [LIVE](https://gatsby-tfs-theme-starter.netlify.app/) and alternatively my digital garden where I am using gatsby-theme-tfs with a couple of modifications.
