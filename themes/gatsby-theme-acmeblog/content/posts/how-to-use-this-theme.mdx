Let's say that you want to start this theme from a blank canvas.
For me the easiest way is to follow the below steps:

1. Create a `package.json` file in a particular folder;
2. You will need to run `npm install` or `yarn`;
3. After that you can start the configuration of your theme;
5. Run `npm run develop` or `yarn develop`... and get an error(for now);
4. Your site need content;

# Package.json

In the root of your selected folder you will be creating your `package.json`
file as follows:

```js
{
  "name": "amce",
  "author": "Tiago Sanchez",
  "main": "index.mdx",
  "license": "MIT",
  "dependencies": {
    "gatsby": "^2.22.15",
    "gatsby-theme-acmeblog": "^1.0.0",
    "react": "^16.4.0",
    "react-dom": "^16.4.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "develop": "gatsby develop",
    "clean": "gatsby clean",
    "build": "gatsby build",
    "serve": "gatsby serve"
  }
}
```

# Npm install or yarn

This will install all the packages that you will need into your folder and
you will need to run this command in your terminal.

# Configuration

There are a couple of things that you will need to consider: 

- The theme options;
- Basic site data configuration; 
- Using Mdx 

It is also important to note that at the moment the slugs are the name of the MDX file.


## Theme options

| key                      | default value    | description                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `pagesContentPath`       | `content/pages`  | location of other pages that you would like to build using `mdx`                                                                                                                           |
| `otherImagesContentPath` | `images`         | location for any other images that you would like to post in your                                                                                                                          |

| `postTableOfContents`    | `false`          | If you would like to have a table of contents in your posts page change it to `true`                                                                                                       |

### How to use theme options

In `gatsby-config.js` you will be able to define the options

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    {
      resolve: "gatsby-theme-acmeblog-data",
      options: {
        blogPath: "/anything", // the default will be /blog
        tagsPath: "/mytags", // the default will be /tags
        categoryPath: "/mycategory", // the default will be /category
        postsContentPath: "myblog/posts", // the default will be content/posts
        pagesContentPath: "myblog/pages", // the default will be content/pages
        otherImagesContentPath: "mysuperimages", // the default will be images
        postTableOfContents: true, //the default is false
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

## Additional configuration

In addition to the theme options the `siteMetadata` object is extremely useful. In our `gatsby-config.js` you will have the following:

```js
siteMetadata: {
    siteTitle: `ACME`,
    siteTitleAlt: `Simple Blog - @tfs/gatsby-theme-acmeblog`,
    siteHeadline: `Simple Blog - Gatsby Theme from tiagofsanchez`,
    // siteUrl: ``,
    siteDescription: `A blogging theme with small aesthetics. Includes tags and categories support`,
    siteLanguage: `en`,
    siteImage: `./images/logo.png`,
    author: `tiagofsanchez`,
    navigation: [
      {
        title: `blog`,
        slug: `/blog`,
      },
      {
        title: `about`,
        slug: `/about`,
      },
    ],
    externalLinks: [
      {
        name: `LinkedIn`,
        url: `https://www.linkedin.com/in/tiagofsanchez/`,
      },
      {
        name: `Twitter`,
        url: `https://twitter.com/tiagofsanchez`,
      },
    ],
  },

```

        },
      ],
    },
      plugins: [
        {
          resolve: "gatsby-theme-acmeblog",
          options: {
            postTableOfContents: true,
          },
        },
      ],
    };
```

## How to use Mdx for your posts

### Url (slug) of your posts

This will be automatically generated for you and it will be the name of the mdx file created

The frontmatter will need to have the following structure

```mdx
---
title: "How to use this theme"
date: "2020-06-08"
category: Use this theme
tags:
  - how to
  - acme
  - gatsby
---
```

- title - will be the title of the blog post
- date - will be the date that will be shown in the blog post;
- category - defines the category of this post
- tags - the tags that you want this particular post to have
- thumbnail - in case you want to give the post a thumbnail

# Time to run your site

Now you can run `npm run develop` or `yarn develop` to get an error :(. Sorry about that. 
The problem here is that we need content for all the magic to happen. 

# Add your content 

Assuming that you are using all the defaults from the theme, you will need 
to add posts, pages and images (dummy for now) into `content/posts`, `content/pages` and `conent/images`


Eh voila! Now you can start to create great content!

If you think you are ready and want deploy your site you can follow [gatsby documenation](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/)

Hope this was usefull.
